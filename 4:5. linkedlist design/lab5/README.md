# Lab 5: Style and cLint

In this lab, we begin to utilize a tool to help us ensure good, 
programming style. 

## Files: 

* clint.py
  * follow instructions to "install" it on your Khoury machine space. 
* grades1.c 
* stuff.c
* Stuff.h
* Makefile

## File you chose to clean up, and issue fixed:

* deque.c
* issues
  * Missing space before {  [whitespace/braces] 
  * Should have a space between // and comment  [whitespace/comments]
  * Line ends in whitespace.  Consider deleting these extra spaces.  [whitespace/end_of_line]
