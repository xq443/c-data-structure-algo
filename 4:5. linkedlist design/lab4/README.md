The lab is about:
- malloc() to create dynamic memory allocation
- free() deallocation the heap memory to avoid memory leek
- using Valgrind to help debug memory issues: valgrind --leak-check=full ./list.c
- create and test linkedlist methods: createList, addNode, removeNodeAt, and removeAllNodesWithValue, and free all memory in the end
