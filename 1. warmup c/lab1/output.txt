LS(1)                                            General Commands Manual                                           

NAME
     ls – list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested,
     associated information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files
     contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given,
     non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in
     lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

     -A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’) except for . and ...  Automatically set for
             the super-user unless -I is specified.

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file
             names as \xxx, where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.  This option is not defined in
             IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -D format
             When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the date and time output.  The argument format
             is a string used by strftime(3).  Depending on the choice of format string, this may result in a different
             number of columns in the output.  This option overrides the -T option.  This option is not defined in IEEE
             Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -F      Display a slash (‘/’) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (‘*’) after each
             that is executable, an at sign (‘@’) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=’) after each socket, a
             percent sign (‘%’) after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.

     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment
             and setting --color=auto.  (See below.)  This functionality can be compiled out by removing the definition
             of COLORLS.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l
             options are specified.

     -I      Prevent -A from being automatically set for the super-user.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std
             1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).

     -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or directory the link references rather than
             the link itself.  This option cancels the -P option.

     -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.  This option is incompatible with IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
             (“POSIX.1”).  See chflags(1) for a list of file flags and their meanings.

     -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than the object the link references.  This
             option cancels the -H and -L options.

     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -S      Sort by size (largest file first) before sorting the operands in lexicographical order.
